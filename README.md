# Hang in There  

### Abstract: We built an app that allows the user to create a custom poster of their choosing, or have a random poster made for them. By Default, on the page load, a random poster is generated. The random poster is created by accessing data stored in titles, quotes and immages arrays. The user can choose to save any poster that is generated by clicking the "Save Poster" button. The poster will then be moved to the Saved Posters page. If the user decides that they no longer would like have a saved copy of a poster they can double click the poster they would like to remove and it will be deleted.
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

### Installation Instructions: git clone git@github.com:dustingouner/hang-in-there.git --- or they can visit https://dustingouner.github.io/hang-in-there/

[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context: The project took about 4 days averaging about 4 hours per day. We are in week 2 of the Turing program.
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

### Contributors: Dustin Gouner - https://github.com/dustingouner   Race Osuna - https://github.com/RaceOsuna

### Learning Goals: The learning goals were to Write clean, DRY JavaScript, understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Build an understanding of writing code collaboratively.
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

### Wins + Challenges: The entire project itself was a challenge. Some stood out more than others. For instance, in one of the functions we had to manipulate the DOM in order to add a new section into the HTML. This biggest challange was learning how class names in the section that we created corresponded to the styling in CSS. We overcame this obsticale with A TON OF TRIAL AND ERROR!!!! As well as reasearching how HTML and CSS interact with each other.
